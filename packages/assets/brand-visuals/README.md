## Overview

The Brand Visuals Library is meant to provide designers and engineers with approved logos, icons, and photography assets for their product design needs. Our goal is to ensure consistency and ease of access to approved visual assets across the Webex Suite. This library will contain only images, logos, and photographs that are relevant to all products within the suite.

Any _**product-specific assets must be independently managed by the respective product teams**_ and will not be included in this centralized library.

## Criteria for Incluseion

**Relevancy**: Only assets that are commonly used across multiple Webex products will be eligible.
**Approval**: All assets must undergo a brand and quality approval process before they can be added.
**Utility**: Assets should be designed to meet the needs of multiple teams and reflect the brandâ€™s visual identity.

## Submission Process
Submissions for new assets to be included in the library can be made through [ðŸ”— Momentumâ€™s Request Form](https://form.asana.com/?k=nOjXcoSB1acIKrLJwHQZ9Q&d=5557457880942). Any requests are subject to approval by the Momentum team and must meet the above criteria.
